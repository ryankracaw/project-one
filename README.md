# The Four Seasons of COVID-19

## Description

The relationship between temperature and COVID-19 cases has been a subject of interest among researchers and policymakers since the early days of the pandemic. Some studies have suggested that warmer temperatures and higher humidity levels may help to reduce the spread of the virus, while others have found no significant association between temperature and COVID-19 transmission.

The motivation behind exploring this relationship is to understand how environmental factors can influence the transmission of the virus, which can help inform public health interventions and policies. For example, if warmer temperatures are found to be associated with lower COVID-19 transmission rates, this could inform decisions about reopening schools and businesses in the summer months. In this project we selected three US counties to study deeper and then split the year into the four seasons: winter, spring, summer, and fall. We based our analysis on the COVID-19 cases per day in each of the four seasons of 2020 vs the temperature, humidity, and wind speed of that day.
